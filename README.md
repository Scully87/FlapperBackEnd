#### The idea was to gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.

##### The first working of the frontend can be found here [FlapperFrontEnd](http://github.com/scully87/FlapperFrontEnd)

#####Technologies Used :

	- MongoDB
	- ExpressJS
	- AngularJS
	- NodeJS

#####How to use (Assuming you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) installed locally) :
